Kia ora,

This is the collection of definitions used for the Vulnerable Older People with Hardship Project.

The final report is available here: https://www.swa.govt.nz/publications/Older-people-experiencing-vulnerability-and-multiple-disadvantage-in-New-Zealand 

The data explorer is available here: https://www.swa.govt.nz/what-we-do/older-people-explorer 


We're currently in the process of tidying up these definitions, some of them are older versions of what we ended up using in the IDI. 
Please reach out to verity.warn002@swa.govt.nz or penny.mok@swa.govt.nz if you've got any questions :)


Cheers!
