## Dependencies

It is necessary to have an IDI project if you wish to run the code. Visit the Stats NZ website for more information about this.

This analysis has been developed for the IDI_Clean_202203 refresh of the IDI. As changes in database structure can occur between refreshes, some updating may be needed to run the code in other refreshes. This code also reads and writes to a project-specific sandpit tables. It will be necessary for others to change these project references when running the code.
